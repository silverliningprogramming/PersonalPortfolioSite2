	<h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
	<p>I am a wife and mother of a wonderful eleven year old boy.  I recently decided to start on a new career and chose the     Computer Programmer/Analyst Program as I have always had an interest in computers.  I converted my fathers Architectural 	     practice to computers years ago. I worked on mainframe systems at a mechanical contracting firm and was always crashing their     system because I was told I input too fast.  I have always been very business oriented and the COBOL 		     programming     course that I took at Georgian College was very business oriented and has struck a chord with me.  It has sparked     an     interest in mainframe programming and I am thinking that this is an area that I might like to pursue in the future.</p>
