	<p><img src="Images/COBOL.jpg" alt="COBOL Assignment" width="600" height="400"/></p>
	<p>This was a COBOL program in which we had to calculate raises for employees in a company in 2 regions and 10 offices who had	 	been with the company over 10 years.  There were approximately 30 employees and about one third were in that category.  Within 	the program I also had to set up headings and set up a sytem that used the current date as input by the user.</p>
