	<p>This was a Java program written in my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming course at Georgian College.  It involved 	    designing a program for a car.  There were four classes for the car: Body, Tank, Engine and Transmission.  These classes were 	    responsible for saying things like what the oil level and fuel levels were, whether the car doors were open or closed, etc. 	    The abstract class Car took this information and depending on what it found out turned the car on, moved the car forward and    backward, shut the car off and other things.  There was also a tester that told you the state of the car and gave you a        dashboard with all the information on the car i.e. fuel tank level, oil level, etc.</p>
