	<p>This was an animation assignment completed in Adobe Flash Professional.  It consisted of a Robot made up of individual 					    parts: head, body, arms, hands and propeller.  Each body part had three different styles of part.  When you clicked on each    individual body part, they changed from one style to the next.  As well as the body parts changing when you clicked on them, 			    the Robot hovered above the ground with a slight up and down movement in the Robot and movement in the various body parts as    well to indicate the slight movement in the Robot.  All of this was achieved using ActionScript language with the Flash  	    Professional program.</p>
